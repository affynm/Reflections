How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It helped me very much to detect the very small typo that would be otherwise difficult to discover.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It's a normal routine to the programmer to test many phrases or syntax or using different approaches to choose the best.
I think keeping track of the versions is very useful to easy locate the needed version of the program

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It's better to control what type of change to commit and also to comment it. 
    The number of vrsions would be more under control and more easy to understand.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because it is clearer and easier to track the changes that are common to multiple files.
Treating files seperately will make it difficult to see the the common changes

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log displays the commits including the commit id and message.
    Git diff between two commit ids will display the ifferences between the two versions. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

It helps to go exactly to a previous set of iles and test them.
And test the rest of the comments to find out which one exactly caused the error.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
